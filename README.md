# Nashville VS Denver



Motivation:

The motivation behind this project is to find out where else I would like to live. Ever since graduating college I have always wanted to start traveling and live in different parts of the United States. Moving from New York to Tennessee really opened my eyes to the joys of experiencing different cultures that exists in the United States. With landing a job in Data Analytics I hope that it would give me the opportunity to travel and work across the nation. With that being said, I am falling in love with Nashville and would not mind spending a few years here, but such a city as Denver might bring bigger and greater opportunities with a better quality of life. So, I hope this project will help answer the question for me whether I should move to a different state or stay in Nashville for some time to come.

Data Questions:

Which city is the safest?

Which city is the most affordable

Which city has the most activities?

Between Nashville and Denver which is the best city for me to live in?
